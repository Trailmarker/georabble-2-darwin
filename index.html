					#### GeoRabble Darwin #2
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					this talk is about systems I helped develop at the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation
					and Safety (DMIRS) in Western Australia from 2015 to 2017

					### The Programme of Work Spatial Lodgement Portal 
					
					PoW-S was launched by DMIRS in March 2017
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					PoW-S replaced old school manual processes with an online system used 
					by mining companies to
					
					* propose exploration activities
					* get realtime feedback
					* streamline the provision of supporting information
					* fast-track "low impact" proposals 
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					in its 2018 Annual Report, DMIRS stated
					
					* **2,643** Programme of Work applications for exploration had been processed
					* assessment times were cut by an average **7-10 days**
					* **93%** of users were _satisfied to very satisfied_ with PoW Spatial usability

					#### The business drivers for PoW-S

					* reduce the time to assess MinEx proposals
					* improve the proposal process for industry users
					* reallocate staff and resources to compliance
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					**exploration ground disturbance activities** include drill holes and pads, tracks, costeans, 
					campsites, core sample farms and surveys
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					an exploration activity is a _spatial object_, and it has

					* a geometry (point, line, polygon)
					* an envelope (buffered hull)
					* metadata which defines how it is processed

					PoW-S is about _entering exploration activities_
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					DMIRS maintains a geodatabase with layers sourced from different WA agencies 

					* mining tenure and tenement data
					* protected flora and fauna
					* national parks and state reserves
					* heritage and sacred sites
					* pastoral leases
					* rivers and bodies of water
					
					about half of about 150 layers are relevant to PoW-S
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Mining tenure

					* a proponent of MinEx activities needs to hold exploration tenure on the area to be disturbed 
					* DMIRS has a demanding SLA on this commercially sensitive public tenure data
					* decisions impact the stock market
				</section>
				<section data-background="assets/img/fortescue-native-title-hit.png">
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Encroachments
					
					in PoW-S, when a proposed activity intersects with a feature in a corporate layer, this 
					is referred to as an _encroachment_

					the geometry of an encroachment is fed into a PoW-S _rules engine_ which behaves 
					differently based on the type of activity and the encroached layer
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Encroachments

					3 possible results of encroachment

					* no impact
					* activity must be removed or changed
					* activity causes an _encumbrance_ needing follow-up
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Activities with no impact
					
					what if all activities in a proposal have no impact? 
					
					it is a candidate for a "low impact" assessment which can be fast-tracked
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Rejected activities

					PoW-S provides two options

					1. remove the problem activity
					2. _excise_ the encroachments (clip all intersecting layers from its envelope)
					
					in the old process, these problems would cause entire proposals to "bounce" and 
					need to be resubmitted
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Encroached and encumbered</h4>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>native title</td>
							<td>document agreement with traditional owners</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>pastoral lease</td>
							<td>notify leaseholder</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>campsite near a watercourse</td>
							<td>define mitigation plan</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					once all rejected activities in a proposal are dealt with, PoW-S generates a 
					wizard-style _questionnaire_ so the proponent can supply the supporting 
					information for the proposal's outstanding encumbrances, as text and attachments
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					once the proposal is submitted and being processed for approval, encumbrances 
					form part of the proponent's contractual obligations under any approved agreement
				</section>
				<section data-background="assets/img/pow-s-dataflow.svg">
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					PoW-S was one of several spatial systems implemented by DMIRS for efficiency and rigour 
					overseeing the mine life cycle, with others to follow
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### FRS or Feature Relationship Services
					
					* a "spatially enabled workflow management engine"
					* not an application, an API (no front end)
					* recorded a network view of relationships between audited groups of features 
					passing through DMIRS processes: proposed, approved, actual
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### EAVie (Environment Assessment VIEwer)

					* one-stop shop for Environment Officers dealing with PoW-S proposals
					* encumbrances generate pro forma contract text
					* activities link to other systems of record via integrated services, displaying context
					* doubled the efficiency of EOs processing proposals
				</section>
				<section data-background="assets/img/eavie-screenshot.png">
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Technology (look away!)
				
					so PoW-S was built on ASP .NET MVC, SQL Server, ESRI ArcGIS Server, Swagger, 
					Angular, Bootstrap, proj4js, ArcGIS JavaScript API, FME Server, 
					ArcPy (but not ArcObjects), among others

					main driver for technology choices was incumbency and the available skill base 

					the same concepts could be implemented with other technologies
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Take away points

					* spatial workflow systems differ from other spatial systems

					* regulatory activity is focused forensically on data
					and legal matters
					
					* productivity gains from automating regulation can be huge
