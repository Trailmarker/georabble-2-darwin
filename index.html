					## Digital regulatory
					## workflow systems 
					
					#### (DMIRS WA case study)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					relating to systems I helped develop at the Department of Mines, 
					Industry Regulation and Safety (DMIRS) in Western Australia 
					from 2015 to 2017

					### The Programme of Work Spatial Lodgement Portal 
					
					PoW-S was launched by DMIRS in March 2017
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					PoW-S replaced existing multi-system and manual processes with 
					a single online system used by mining companies to
					
					* propose exploration activities
					* get realtime feedback
					* streamline the provision of supporting information
					* fast-track "low impact" proposals 
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					in its 2018 Annual Report, DMIRS stated
					
					* **2,643** Programme of Work applications for exploration had been processed
					* assessment times were cut by an average **7-10 days**
					* **93%** of users were _satisfied to very satisfied_ with PoW Spatial usability

					#### The business drivers for PoW-S

					* reduce the time to assess MinEx proposals
					* improve the proposal process for industry users
					* reallocate staff and resources (eg to compliance)
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>many activities subject to regulation are inherently 
					located in space: planning, mining, land use, environmental management</p>

					<p class="fragment">clear communication about regulating these activities 
						can occur in a <em>spatial view</em></p>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					**activities** and **regulatory datasets** are the inputs to business rules that
					generate the **encumbrances** for a proposal 
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Activities

					a proposed **activity** is a _spatial object_

					* has a geography (point, line, polygon)
					* may have metadata affecting how it is processed
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Activities 

					eg: in PoW-S, **exploration ground disturbance activities** 
					include drill holes and pads, tracks, costeans, campsites, core sample 
					farms and geophysical surveys
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Regulatory datasets

					* datasets maintained by a regulator or a partner agency
					* a determining role in regulatory activity
					* usually a spatial dataset
					
					(at DMIRS there were over 100 corporate spatial layers, 
					about half were relevant to PoW-S)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Regulatory datasets

					* mining tenure and cadastral data
					* protected flora and fauna
					* national park boundaries
					* heritage and sacred sites
					* pastoral leases
					* rivers and bodies of water

					<h4>Encumbrances</h4>
			
					<p>an <strong>encumbrance</strong> relates to a proposed activity and 
						represents additional obligations</p>
			
					<p class="fragment">an encumbrance can also determine whether
						additional information must be supplied with a proposed activity
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Encumbrances</h4>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>native title</td>
							<td>document agreement with traditional owners</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>pastoral lease</td>
							<td>notify leaseholder</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>campsite near a watercourse</td>
							<td>define mitigation plan</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</section>
				<section data-background="assets/img/proposed-activity-outcomes.svg"></section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Proponent supporting information

					Based on the proposal encumbrances, the proposal system generates a 
					structured _online form_ so the proponent can supply supporting 
					information for encumbrances, as text and attachments
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Low impact proposals</h4>
				
					<p>what if all activities in a proposal have no impact?</p>
				
					<p class="fragment">it is a candidate for a "low impact" assessment 
						which can be fast-tracked</p>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Benefits for proponents

					1. single consistent view of proposal
					1. ETL proposal data from proponent systems
					1. proposal can be edited in situ
					1. instant view of (some) encumbrances on proposed activities
					1. instant view of reasons for failure
				</section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						#### Digital regulation: assessors
				
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						#### Benefits for assessors
				
						1. integration of supporting data in a single view
						* legal fragments
						* levy and fee calculations
						* administrative data
						1. "low impact" proposals can be fast-tracked
						1. rendering of reports back to proponents is (partly) automatic
					</section>
					<section data-background="assets/img/eavie-screenshot.png"></section>
					<section data-markdown>
						#### Assessment system example: EAVie (Environment Assessment VIEwer)
					
						* one-stop shop for DMIRS Environment Officers dealing with PoW-S proposals
						* encumbrances generate pro forma contract text
						* activities link to other systems of record via integrated services, displaying context
						* goal was to double the efficiency of EOs processing proposals
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Phased approach</h4>

					<p>not everything needs to be built at once</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						PoW-S was one of several systems implemented by DMIRS for efficiency and rigour
						overseeing the mine life cycle, with others to follow for more complex proposal
						types
					</p>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Take away points

					* digital regulatory workflow systems are spatial systems
					* based on detailed business analysis of all or some assessment factors
					* productivity wins for both external and internal use cases
					* huge process wins: transparency and unity
